DYNAMATE HISTORY
</b><p>

A couple of years ago me and my friend Bj&ouml;rn Kalzen developed a
game for the Amiga. Bj&ouml;rn programmed and made levels, I did the
graphics, music and levels.<p>

The game was released as licenceware by F1 in U.K. but only eleven
persons discovered the game. That's not a developers dream -eleven
users :-). We talked about putting it on the Aminet, but none of us had
any internet experience nor connections, so we never did.<p>

However the game never really left my thoughts, so when I registered
as a Be developer I needed an easy project to start with, this game was
the obvious choise.<p>
