<p><hr> <b>HOW TO PLAY</b><p>

You move pieces by dragging them. A piece slide until it hit something. 
If it slides out of the game the level is abandoned. If a piece has a
circle around it it can't be moved.<p>

The goal of the game is to get
rid of all stones (red, green, blue, black, yellow).  If certain
stones collide in certain ways they both dissapear. The following
moves causes the involved stones to dissapear:<p> <blockquote>
	A red stone dragged to a green.<br>
	A green stone dragged to a blue.<br>
	A blue stone dragged to a red.<br>
	(note the circularity)<p>

</center>

	A black stone dragged to any other stone.<br>
	Any stone(exept yellow) dragged to a yellow<br>
	(note the hierarcy)<br> </blockquote>

If stones collide in any other way the dragged stone just stops.  (wich
will show essential to the game later)<br> If a red is dragged on a row
of green they all will dissapear, the domino effect. the same holds for
a black dragged to a row of stones in all colours.<br> The above
described is the only way of getting rid of stones.<p>

Observe: With stones is meant only the red, green, blue, green, black,
yellow. The others are called pieces.<br> Now you know enough to play
the level called tutorial. Do that.<p>

The all gray piece is the boring guy around here. It is used to stack
other pieces on. (you stack stones on stones to, if they are stacked in
the right order)<p>

</center>

The piece with a lightning is a teleporter, they work in pairs
only. If something enter one of them it exits the other with unchanged
direction. If you drag one teleporter to the other it just continues
right through it.<p>

</center>

The piece that looks like small red, green, blue stones cykles
the colour of red, green and blue stones.<p>

<center>
<img width=32 height=32 src="gif/arrow.gif"><p>
</center>

The piece with straight arrows on it only let pieces through
in the direction of the arrow.<p>

<center>
<img width=32 height=32 src="gif/dircykle.gif"><p>
</center>

The piece with a circular arrow on it changes the direction of things
that go through it.<p>

The skull abandones the level when something is dragged to
it.<p>

<hr>
That might have seemed awfully complicated. It ain't! <p>
Just play around a while and you'll get the point. The most
important thing to learn is the order of the red - green - blue
stones.<p>

Good Luck!
