HOW TO PLAY

Click the icon to start DynaMate, then drop a level there to
start the game. (you can drop everything, but it's in most
cases pretty useless)

You move pieces by dragging them. A piece slide until it hit
something. If it slides out of the game the level is abandoned.
If a piece has a circle around it it can't be moved.

The goal of the game is to get rid of all stones (red, green,
blue, black, yellow). If certain stones collide in certain ways
they both dissapear. The following moves causes the involved
stones to dissapear:

	A red stone dragged to a green.
	A green stone dragged to a blue.
	A blue stone dragged to a red.
	(note the circularity)
	
	A black stone dragged to any other stone.
	Any stone(exept yellow) dragged to a yellow
	(note the hierarcy)

If stones collide in any other way the dragged stone just stops.
(wich will show essential to the game later)
If a red is dragged on a row of green they all will dissapear,
the domino effect. the same holds for a black dragged to a row
of stones in all colours.
The above described is the only way of getting rid of stones.

Observe: With stones is meant only the red, green, blue, green,
black, yellow. The others are called pieces.
Now you know enough to play the level called tutorial. Do that.

The all gray piece is the boring guy around here. It is used to
stack other pieces on. (you stack stones on stones to, if they
are stacked in the right order)

The piece with a lightning is a teleporter, they work in pairs
only. If something enter one of them it exits the other with
unchanged direction. If you drag one teleporter to the other it
just continues right through it.

The piece that looks like small red, green, blue stones cykles
the colour of red, green and blue stones.

The piece with straight arrows on it only let pieces through in
the direction of the arrow.

The piece with a circular arrow on it cycles the direction of
the piece dragged to it.

The skull abandones the level when something is dragged to it.

The white piece with a number makes the following (number on
piece) moves "one step at a time".

HISTORY

A couple of years ago me and my friend Björn Kalzen developed a
game for the Amiga. Björn programmed and made levels, I did
the graphics, music (this version doesn't have sound at all)
and levels.

The game was released as licenceware by F1 in U.K. but only
eleven persons discovered the game. That's not a developers
dream -eleven users :-). We talked about putting it on the
Aminet, but none of us had any internet experience nor
connections, so we never did.

However the game never really left my thoughts, so when I
registrated as a Be developer I needed an easy project to start
with, this game was the obvious choise.

980110 alpha 
	Play the game, Dropload levels 
	no sound, no highscore, no demos, not saving moves, not
	many levels, ugly "scrolling".

980115 v1
	Play the game, Dropload levels, saving highscore.

980206 v1.1
	Major speed-increase. Discovered what you _can_ do with
	DrawBitmap().
